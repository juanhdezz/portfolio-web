        I am pleased to announce that my team has won the 5th edition of the UGR Ideas Factory program! 🏆\n\n

        It has been an incredible experience from which I have learned several lessons, not only about business, but about life:

        1. The importance of being a good team, of having good people and good people. The technical is as important as the personal. It is useless to have the best minds if they are not going to encourage you not to give up, not to be afraid of making mistakes. 👥

        2. Where there is a will, there is a way. It sounds very utopian, but what depends on you, you can control. Easy? Of course not! The first time you will fail, the second time too but less, the third time you will do much better. Some ideas that have helped me to face this have been: • Mentally prepare yourself before each important moment, of what you are about to do, imagine how you want to do it 🧠 • Trust in that idea and in what you CAN do 💪 • Analyze how what you had in mind has turned out, observe very carefully the errors, but BE CAREFUL, also the successes! 🔍 • Think about how you can solve those errors and COMMENT THEM with your team, why? Because they will give you an additional opinion, of what is appreciated in third persons and ALSO when you communicate a problem, you assume it at a higher level of concreteness, our head tends to ignore some details if we do not express them verbally. 🗣️

        3. Get out of my comfort zone. Another phrase that I have heard 200 thousand times in the times we live in, but what does it mean? Does it mean sacrificing your hobbies? Of course NOT! Getting out of that zone means doing something you would like to do but don't feel like it, your head tells you it's a hassle, that you'd better stay as you are, that you're fine. This is the biggest limiter of your potential, procrastination, overcoming it means getting out of your comfort zone. 🚀

        It has been a highly recommended experience, which will undoubtedly teach you in a practical way everything I have mentioned, in addition to the roller coaster that means starting a business, the complexity of giving shape to a fleeting idea, the ability to synthesize and filter points of view, the ability to communicate technical and personal opinions, and much more. 🎢

        I would like to thank the organizers for this experience and encourage them to continue with it! 🙏
