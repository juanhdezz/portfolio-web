  I'm excited to share that I’ve completed the Business Intelligence, Data Discovery, and SQL training at Cívica! 🎉📊
  
  From day one, I knew it would be worth it. The positive energy from the instructors, their professionalism, and the passion they brought to every session made this course something truly special 🙌🏽.
  
  A huge thank you to Manuel Muñoz Megías, Ana Bosch Fernández, Evaristo Laraño Castaño, Eduardo Laraño Castaño, Antonio Fernández-Valadés Gámez, Francisco Mantell Zamudio, Jose Morales Espínola, and the entire Cívica team for creating such an inspiring experience 🌟.

        Last Wednesday we put the finishing touch to a project we had been working on for months, and I couldn't be more proud of what we have achieved. 🎉

I'm talking about Bucadin, the revolutionary application that, a few months ago, allowed us to win the first UGR competition. 🏆 At that moment, we realized that there was really something powerful in our idea, something with a future. 💡

With that motivation, we decided to continue working, researching and proposing value to the user. As a result, we were invited to participate in the VIII UGR Ideas Competition, a more competitive competition. First we faced the projects of students from the ETSIIT, where we were lucky enough to win and represent our faculty in the final. 🙌

It was an incredible experience that allowed us to take third place 🥉 and see up close the 19 best ideas from the universities of Granada, Ceuta and Melilla. A space where we not only had the opportunity to show our idea, but also to sell it. 💼

This process made me aware of something important: as María José González López said, the biggest barrier to innovation is the fear of failure or shame. 💭 That's why initiatives like this are so valuable: they help us break down all those barriers that limit our potential, our way of seeing the world and understanding real needs. 🔓

Not only in the field of entrepreneurship, but also in terms of personal growth. The lessons learned are priceless. 📚

Thanks to the entire team I've had for their effort, and to UGR Emprendedora for giving us the opportunity to show what we can achieve together.🚀

        I am pleased to announce that my team has won the 5th edition of the UGR Ideas Factory program! 🏆\n\n

        It has been an incredible experience from which I have learned several lessons, not only about business, but about life:

        1. The importance of being a good team, of having good people and good people. The technical is as important as the personal. It is useless to have the best minds if they are not going to encourage you not to give up, not to be afraid of making mistakes. 👥

        2. Where there is a will, there is a way. It sounds very utopian, but what depends on you, you can control. Easy? Of course not! The first time you will fail, the second time too but less, the third time you will do much better. Some ideas that have helped me to face this have been: • Mentally prepare yourself before each important moment, of what you are about to do, imagine how you want to do it 🧠 • Trust in that idea and in what you CAN do 💪 • Analyze how what you had in mind has turned out, observe very carefully the errors, but BE CAREFUL, also the successes! 🔍 • Think about how you can solve those errors and COMMENT THEM with your team, why? Because they will give you an additional opinion, of what is appreciated in third persons and ALSO when you communicate a problem, you assume it at a higher level of concreteness, our head tends to ignore some details if we do not express them verbally. 🗣️

        3. Get out of my comfort zone. Another phrase that I have heard 200 thousand times in the times we live in, but what does it mean? Does it mean sacrificing your hobbies? Of course NOT! Getting out of that zone means doing something you would like to do but don't feel like it, your head tells you it's a hassle, that you'd better stay as you are, that you're fine. This is the biggest limiter of your potential, procrastination, overcoming it means getting out of your comfort zone. 🚀

        It has been a highly recommended experience, which will undoubtedly teach you in a practical way everything I have mentioned, in addition to the roller coaster that means starting a business, the complexity of giving shape to a fleeting idea, the ability to synthesize and filter points of view, the ability to communicate technical and personal opinions, and much more. 🎢

        I would like to thank the organizers for this experience and encourage them to continue with it! 🙏
